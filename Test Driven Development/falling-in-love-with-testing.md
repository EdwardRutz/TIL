# Falling in Love with Testing

It's love at first site.  

On one command the entire code base is checked and confirmed working.
No more...
- clicking through links to make sure they are not broken
- manually walking through the app to check for problems
- adding new code then wondering where and why the app broke

Now, it's easy to...
- demonstrate to clients the app runs 
- port and install
- explain what the app does by going through the test
- trouble shoot problems

Sometimes the fingers typing on the keyboard tell the heart, "this is a lot of extra work and code, break up with testing."

But the brain jumps in and adds...
- It's easy to outline the code and add tests as a way to plan what to write
- A little extra effort now saves a lot of time later
- Code and relax knowing that the parts are working as designed.


## TL;DR

Test Driven Development is a great way to outline code and save time.
