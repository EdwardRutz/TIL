# Kanban


#### Today I learned more about Kanban...

Over coffee, Brendan gave me good insights into Kanban.

Kanban offers a way of making change through incremental imporvements.  By managing work in progress (WIP) the flow of work items is maximized.

Too much mismanaged work is cancerous and will severely degrade productivity and capacity.

A few Kanban insights...

- Activities form workflow
- Unhide work
- Limit WIP
- Pull work through the system, not push
- Swarming
