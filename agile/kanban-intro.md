# Kanban Introduction


#### Today I learned more about Kanban...

Over coffee, Brendan W. gave me good insights into Kanban. 

Kanban offers a way of making changes through incremental imporvements.  By managing work in progress (WIP) the flow of work items is maximized.

Too much mismanaged work is cancerous and severely degrades productivity and capacity.

A few Kanban insights...

- Activities form workflow
- Unhide work
- Limit WIP
- Pull work through the system, not push
- Swarming

Times up, more to add someday-soon...
