# Setting Goals Without Setting Goals
1-30-18, Edward Rutz


#### Today I learned books let me set goals without setting goals...

Forget about time intensive goal-setting. If you want to set goals but don't want the intensive waterfall planning that can go with it, try reading.

### 1. Instead of goals, pick six books to read on topics important to you. 
  - Key topics for growth include: mental, spiritual, social and physical
  - If you want to improve a relationship, read a relationship book. If you want to improve finances, read a book about finances.

### 2. Read a book a little bit each day (15-30 minutes) and apply what your learn. 
  - Write about your reading and how you are applying it in your life.
  - If you don't want to take notes or write about what you are learning and doing, talk to people about your reading. Better yet write and talk to others.
  - Review your notes from time-to-time.

- BONUS: find a friend to read the same book and talk about it on a regular basis.

That's it!  Read, learn and apply.

By the end of the year, you will grow and improve.


## TL;DR
- Set goals by picking 6 books to read this year, read the book, apply what you learn, write about it and in a year you will grow and improve.
