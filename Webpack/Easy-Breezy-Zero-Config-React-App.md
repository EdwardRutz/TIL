# Easy, Breezy, React Zero Config App

1-18-18, Edward Rutz

Today I learned the react-create-app package is quick, easy and awesome.

Mid-sized and smaller React are quick and easy with "react-create-app." This official React build installs everything needed along with configuring the webserver for a simple install.

- It uses Webpack and Babel with minmal configuration
- Best part, the web server is ready to go with no configuration needed
- ESLint in integrated and shows lint warnings in the console
- Only one dependency and a few scripts in package.json
- Zero configuration
- More dependecies, scripts and configs can be installed and customizing by using the "eject" command. This cannot be reversed and scripts must be maintained manually.

## Install, Setup and Run

- Globally install:  ```npm install -g create-react-app```

- Create an app:  ```create-react-app hello-world```

- To begin development and run the web server, run: ```npm start```

- Create and optimize the build:  ```npm run build```

And did I mention it is quick, easy and requires no configuration.


## TL;DR
- The "create-react-app" is an official React build setup that needs no configuration.
- It uses Webpack and Babel with minmal configuration
- Best part, the web server is ready to go with no configuration needed
- ESLint in integrated and shows lint warnings in the console
- Only one dependency and a few scripts in package.json
- Zero configuration
- More dependecies, scripts and configs can be installed and customizing by using the "eject" command. This cannot be reversed and scripts must be maintained manually.
