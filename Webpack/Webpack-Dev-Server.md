# Webpack Dev Server

#### Score:  Webpack-dev-server: 2, Junior Dev: 1.

The Webpack-Dev-Server provides a fast way to develop apps along with live-updating changes to a webpack bundle.

So far using webpack-dev-server is finicky. On the bright side, my ability configuring webpack, webpack.config.js and package.json files is growing stronger. 

One benefit of webpack-dev-server is the ability to live-update the bundle.js file with the changes made to the index.js file.  This is much easier than remaking the bundle.js after each change.

Each installation of the webpack-dev-server led to a different result...the webserver hanging, errors with Content Security Policy (CSP) and failing to update.  This is more likely a reflection of my lack of experience with it but it still burns time I'd rather spend coding.

For now I have spent enough time fiddling with it and will use another web server and the Watch command to update bundle.js. Or even do it manually with each change. It is more important to keep coding without interruptions.  Will give it another try later.

#### Steps to adding the watch command and for dealing with CSP issues.

##### Add a Watch command to automate building bundle.js
- In package.json add ```"watch": "webpack --w"``` to the scripts object...
- RESULT: 
```
       "scripts": {
          "build": "webpack",
          "watch": "webpack --w"
        },
```
- Next run ```npm run watch``` to monitor changes
- RESULT:
```
Webpack is watching the filesâ€¦
```

##### Solving Content Security Policy Issues
- [MDN: Content Security Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/default-src)
- [SO: CSP](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42401952/inline-style-error-with-content-security-policy-and-javascript#42402277)



#### TL;DR

- The web-dev-server is a powerful tool that may take time to learn and configure correctly.
- Spend more time coding and less time wrestling configurations to get a tool to work.
