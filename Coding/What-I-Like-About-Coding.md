# What I Like About Coding

1-17-18, Edward Rutz

#### Today I learned what I like about coding...

#### Making it Work 
- One of aspect of coding I really like is figuring out the puzzle of how to get the code to do what is needed and how to fix it when it breaks. It is a thrill when you find the hidden secret that gets the code to run. My heart skips a beat every time.

- Today I enjoyed several instances of fixing broken code.  Slowly I'm getting better and quicker in figuring out what is wrong and how to fix it.

#### Learning Something New
- It is great to learn a new pattern or technique and make it work. The downside is it can take time to learn but in the end applying what is learned and making it work is fun.

#### Growing and Getting Good
- Coding gives plenty of opportunity to master a skill or concept and get good. It is fun to feel the improvement as you grow and get better. Slowly becoming quicker at solving problems, relying less on google and deepening understanding.

- The more code we write and problems we solve the better we get.

#### Persistence and Triumph
- Charge and push until you get the code working. Like a rhino charging through obstacles or a dog with a bone holding on tightly, keep going until you get it working.  It is just a matter of time. 

- If I'm not careful I will burn too much time working on a problem so I have learned to set milestones and time limits I need to get results.

- When learning something new, I like to wrestle with it on my own until I get it. Working in groups is fun, especially when we are building a project, but I'm more effective with learning on my own and applying knowledge with a group. It's fun to figure out the solution instead of having someone give it to me.

#### Inspirational Quote
- The greatest oak was once a little nut who held its ground.
