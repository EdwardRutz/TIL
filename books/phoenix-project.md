#### _Today I learned about DevOps..._

 The Phoenix Project by Gene Kim is a fun book to read and it gives you a solid understanding of how a productive DevOps team works. The story is engaging, full of corporate drama around I.T. so those who enjoy technology and business will enjoy it. The story makes a great audio book to listen to while driving, walking or to relax with at the end of the day.

 Today I finished reading the book for the third time. I like how the story is full of I.T. best practices that unfold as the characters solve one problem after another. It gives you a glimpse into the workings of a corporate DevOps department.

Auto Parts Unlimited is plagued with constant network and software development problems which are causing the company to fail in the market place and lose money.  By implementing LEAN and Agile practices the company solve problems quickly and becomes the market leader.

A few highlights from the book include...
